Unpack: unpack your archives
============================

A simple utility to unpack different types of archives with a consistent
interface. All of the following work as expected:

    unpack --extract archive.zip
    unpack --extract archive.7z
    unpack --extract archive.tar.gz
    unpack --extract archive.tar.bz2
    unpack --extract archive.tar.xz

This is based on the filename, so it is not very robust, but it works well for
99% of the cases where you don't want to always be looking up the right
combination of flags.
